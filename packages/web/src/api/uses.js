          For every JavaScript or PHP project,{' '}
          <strong>VSCode is my go-to choice</strong>. Never regreted leaving
          Atom ecosystem... VSCode is by far the best including IntelliSense.
          <br />I use Ahmad Awais'{' '}
          <strong>Shades of Purple VSCode theme</strong> that looks incredibly
          cool...

          <strong>*</strong> I use <strong>Hyper Terminal</strong> instead of
          the normal OSX terminal.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>*</strong> It is configured with{' '}
          <em>
            <strong>ohmyzsh</strong>
          </em>{' '}
          and <strong>zsh </strong>for doing terminal operations.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>*</strong> I have configured{' '}
          <strong>Shades of Purple Theme for HyperTerm </strong>which uses{' '}
          <strong>Dank Mono font</strong> for terminal.
          <br />
          <br />

          <strong>*</strong> For learning JavaScript and Node.JS, I have always{' '}
          <strong>watched YouTube tutorials</strong> and preferred not buying
          premium courses.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>*</strong> Recently, I completed{' '}
          <strong>WesBos' Advanced React course</strong> to learn about
          React.JS, Next.JS, and GraphQL/Prisma.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>* </strong>Reading a lot of blog posts helped me a ton to
          learn things by myself. <strong>Will list many here soon</strong>!
